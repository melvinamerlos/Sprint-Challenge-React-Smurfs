1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing is an old school way of interneting. Each time click a link an entire HMTL file with CSS and Javascript will be downloaded. Each time you navigate from one web page to another, this process repeats itself over and over and is really inefficient.

Whereas....

Client-side routing is the more modern way to surf the interweb. EVERYTHING is downloaded all at once and the architecture is already in place for the user to navigate from once page to the next withou any loading time because all that content is downloaded from the beginning.
